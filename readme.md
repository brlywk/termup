# termup

My personal **term**inal set**up** tool.

# What?

Termup is a small tool that is meant to make setting up and configuring my terminal environment just a littlebit easier.
It is meant to automate the process of installing prerequisites ([homebrew], [git](https://git-scm.com), [chezmoi]) on
the system
before starting the process of actually setting everything else up with [chezmoi].

# How?

Coming soon(-ish)...

# Why?

I already use the excellent [chezmoi] to manage
my [dotfiles](https://www.github.com/brlywk/dotfiles), but there is still a few steps to take
before Chezmoi is up and running. Also: Just for fun ðŸ¤“.
